## 📝 Implementation Notes

**For Seeder (`database/seeders/MusicDataSeeder.php`):**

1. Create all genres with proper slug generation
2. Create all vibes with color codes
3. Create all instruments categorized properly
4. Set proper sort_order for each
5. Mark all as is_active = true by default

**Important:**
- Use `Str::slug()` for generating slugs
- Validate color codes (7 characters including #)
- Ensure unique names and slugs
- Categories must match enum values in migration

**Testing Data:**
- Create at least 3 test compositions with different combinations
- Test both predefined and custom inputs
- Verify relationships work correctly
